# Coder OSS with Terraform

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate how remote development environments work using [Coder's OSS product](https://github.com/coder/coder). This repo should not be used for production use cases, but simply a proof-of-concept for what coding-in-a-browser feels like using Coder.
